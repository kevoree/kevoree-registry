# TODO
## Frontpage
 - Main : Type Script research

## Namespace
  - only owner can add members
  - only owner can remove 
  - no one can remove a namespace
  - no one can update a namespace
  - only owner can deactivate his namespace (and only an activated namespace can be deactivated)

## Deploy units
  - the latest criteria should not impact DU but TD. If latest is **true** only the DU of the lastets TD should be returned. Also the latest criteria can now be integrated to the TD search

## Type Definition
  - one can only attach a TD to an activated namespace where he is a member.
  - integration of the latest criteria in the TD search.

## CLI : 
  - namespaces user management in cli ?
  - CRUD DU in cli (can a DU be updated, maybe only its priority ?)

## Typescript
Migrating the http javascript api to typescript
